  <h1> Event Details </h1>

	<h2> Art and Wine Festival </h2>
	<p> If you have signed up to work at the Art & Wine Festival this Saturday, 9/13/2014, or Sunday, 9/14/2014, please report to the former Millikin cafeteria, located at 2720 Sonoma Place, at your designated time.  There will be sign in sheets for you to sign in when you arrive.  When you are ready to leave please remember to sign out.  Thank you and we look forward to seeing you this weekend!!! As in the past, we will be using the old Millikin site for the Art & Wine Festival Parking. The use of the lawn areas for parking is a money maker for the school. We need a few experienced volunteers to set up the parking areas each morning at 8:00 AM and more volunteers to help direct cars to the lawn area, either on Saturday, September 14 or on Sunday, September 15 from 9am to 6pm. This is a great way to earn volunteer hours! On-line sign ups through VolunteerSpot are below. Shifts are usually one hour, but parents may help for up to four hours per family. Our high quality music, science, computer, and after school sports programs benefit from the funds obtained from this event. We will charge $5.00 for cars to park on the blacktop and lawn areas.</p>

<h2> Annual Food Drive </h2>
<p> Our annual food drive is going on from February 3rd until February 7th. This year we are collecting for the food pantry at St. Justin’s Church, right next door to the Santa Clara Central Library. They receive food from food drives like ours, plus Second Harvest Food Bank, then distribute directly to hungry families, seniors and the homeless.  St. Justin’s pantry provides food to anyone in need from the Santa Clara community.  By contributing to the drive, we are truly helping our neighbors.The goal for each classroom is 150 food items, i.e. one can or box of food = one item.  We are requesting 5 items from each student.   This need not be a huge expense for your family.  Many canned and boxed grocery items can be purchased on sale for $.50-$1 apiece.  If you are giving from your own pantry, please double-check to make sure you are not donating expired items.  Canned soup, vegetables, beans and chili are all helpful, as are things like macaroni-and-cheese, dried beans, rice, and peanut butter. 
Also kindly let me know if any of the parents, are looking for volunteer hours. He/she will be responsible to move the cans from the classroom on Monday, February 3rd, Wednesday, February 5th to  the holding site(which most probably a H wing storage room, but will be confirmed later).
They will be responsible to unload donations inside the room and record the number of items you’re dropping off on the clipboard inside the storage room. Feel free to contact me with any questions, and don’t forget that donations can be sent in with your child starting Monday, February 3rd.
